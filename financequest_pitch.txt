Welcome fiscal adventurer.

Today is your tenth birthday. Like every normal person in FINANCEWORLD, this is the age at which you leave home and begin your equity adventure.

Your dream is to collect all of the sharés, and hold the most diverse portfolio ever.

After breakfast, you go to visit PROFESSOR SCHLEPPENHUND in your back garden.

"You're just in time! I have perfected the design of my SHARÉDEX. My dream was to build a system to track all of the shares in our world. But I'm too old now, so I need you to do it."
"Try to meet as many sharés as you can!"
